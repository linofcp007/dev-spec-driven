# Feature: Usage Metering

## Summary
[1-2 sentences: what this does and why it matters]

## User Stories (prioritized — each independently testable)

Priorities: **P1** = critical, a viable MVP on its own · **P2** = secondary · **P3** = enhancement.
Each story must deliver standalone value if shipped alone.

### US-1 (P1 — MVP): [Story Title]
**As a** [role], **I want** [capability], **so that** [benefit].
**Why P1:** [why this is the minimum viable slice]
**Independent Test:** Can be fully tested by [specific action] and delivers [specific value], without the other stories.

#### Acceptance Criteria (EARS)
1. **US-1.AC-1** — WHEN [trigger] THE SYSTEM SHALL [behavior]
2. **US-1.AC-2** — WHILE [state], WHEN [trigger] THE SYSTEM SHALL [behavior]
3. **US-1.AC-3** — IF [error condition] THEN THE SYSTEM SHALL [recovery]
4. **US-1.AC-4** — [ubiquitous] THE SYSTEM SHALL [always-true property]
5. **US-1.AC-5** — WHEN a user from tenant A requests data, THE SYSTEM SHALL NOT return any record whose tenant_id != A.
6. **US-1.AC-6** — THE SYSTEM SHALL respond within [N]ms at P95.


### US-2 (P2): [Story Title]
**As a** [role], **I want** [capability], **so that** [benefit].
**Independent Test:** [how to test this alone]

#### Acceptance Criteria (EARS)
1. **US-2.AC-1** — WHEN [trigger] THE SYSTEM SHALL [behavior]

## Success Criteria (measurable, technology-agnostic)
Outcomes the feature must achieve — business/UX, not implementation. Quantify each.
- **SC-001** — [e.g., 90% of users complete [task] in under [N] seconds]
- **SC-002** — [e.g., error rate on [flow] stays below [N]%]

## Edge Cases & Error Handling
- **EC-1** — [Scenario]: [Expected behavior]

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-1** — [measurable performance / security / accessibility constraint]

## Out of Scope
- [What this feature does NOT include]

## Assumptions
- [Anything assumed true that, if wrong, changes the spec]

<!-- EARS: every AC contains SHALL/DEVE/DEBE and is testable; avoid vague terms; keep stable AC IDs.
     Mark any ambiguity inline with a bracketed marker like  [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which provider?] .
     The design phase is gated — it cannot start while any such marker remains unresolved. -->
